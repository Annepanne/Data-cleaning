Course 3: getting and cleaning data

The folder contains run_analysis.R - the R program to process the data according to the assignment.

In addition there are files containing codebooks
(coodebook_meanAndStd.docx and codebook_meanAndStd.Rmd are the codebook files for the assignment step 4, while the codeBook_avgByActivityAndSubject.docx and .Rmd are the files for step p)

The clean data can be found in cleanData.csv (up to step 4), and avgByActivityAndSubject.csv for step 5.
